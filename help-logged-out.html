ways to fund it. There are no gatekeepers like grant judges or exhibition juries.

rewards according to the schedule established for each reward. It is the obligation of 
every campaign creator to see to it that their patrons receive the rewards they expect. 
ArtCrowd offers creators fulfillment management tools online to monitor the process but 
does not intervene in an individual campaigns execution or stratification
 of delivery. </p>
 
 <p>Patrons need to appreciate that they are supporting the creation of something new, not 
ordering an artwork that already exists. Problems may arise that prevent a creator from 
fulfilling a reward promise but then the creator must make every reasonable effort to find a 
way of bringing the project to a satisfying conclusion for their backers. For more

Collections function differently from Creator Online Galleries. The Online Galleries feature 
work by the creator that is uploaded to a their profile allowing for captioning of artwork 
credits and incorporation into funding campaigns, 
while Art Collections are available to 
ArtCrowd members only for art appreciation and social sharing. Artworks in a Collection 
cannot be caption edited by the collector and the creator’s ownership of the art is 
protected. Patrons are encouraged to add artworks they appreciate to their Art Collections 
in their profiles and spread the word about the art they love by social sharing. Just as it is 
free to exhibit in the ArtCrowd, it is also free to create your own ArtCrowd Art Collection.

                      <p>ArtCrowd will walk you through the steps of building a profile to identify your artistic brand, exhibit your 
artwork online and design a funding campaign to get results. Just follow the 
<strong class="undrline">Step by Step Guide
.</strong>
</p>
<p> 
Your 
<strong>artistic brand</strong>
 is the information and art you use to build your ArtCrowd profile. 
 </p>
 <p>
Create a funding 
<strong>Campaign</strong>
 that has a clear cut goal, such as framing a group of paintings for an exhibit, 
printing an exhibition catalogue or building a studio. Choose goals that are realistic and give your patrons 
a sense of contribution to your art.
</p>
 <p>
The 
<strong>funding goal</strong>
 is the amount of money you need to raise to complete objective of the campaign, 
Funding is all or nothing. Your patrons will not be charged if your campaign does not reach its funding 
goal. So designing
 an attainable objective is crucial to success. 
 </p>
 <p>
<strong>Patrons</strong>
 are the generous art lovers who fund your campaign
 to make your art goals a reality. 
 </p>
 <p>
<strong>Rewards</strong>
 are the gifts, Patrons select in recognition of their funding. The best rewards are limited unique 
experiences and by products related to the creative process for which you are seeking funding. Rewards 
are not intended as a means for selling your art, as in an commercial online gallery. Instead it is best to 
offer experiences like a chance to spend a day in your studio, or the chance to go on a nature walk with 
the artist to find sites for landscape paintings, or just meet the artist in a cafe or bar for a beverage. The 
most successful campaigns are the ones that do more than just raise money, they develop relationships 
with your supporters. A successful funding campaign does more than just make the goal possible, it 
creates long term benefits for both the campaign creator and the patron. 
</p>
<p>
If you want to get inspired, dive into ArtCrowd and look around. You’re an artist after all, the only limits are 
your imagination. </p>

concerns reported by its users. Anyone found to be engaged in unethical activity will be warned if minor, and 
banned if serious. Hate speech, intolerance and threats will not be tolerated. ArtCrowd does not ban nudity, which

                      <p>Like any investment, prospective Patrons should show due diligence in selecting the artists they support through 
ArtCrowd. Investing  in any speculative area is inherently risky. Risk is offset by rewards if the art you support 
succeeds. Look for artists with a track record, whose work is visible elsewhere and who’s claims seem credible. 
Contact the artist and ask them about their experience, their exhibits and all relevant information you need to 
decide if the art deserves your support. Don’t hesitate to contact an artist or organization. If they are serious, 
informed about what they do and respond, chances are they will be a good investment. </p>
<p>
ArtCrowd itself can make no representations about the viability of any artist on it’s site, however, ArtCrowd is a very 
public site and artists here put their reputations on the line. Respect their commitment. Understand the risks. 
Appreciate your roll as a Patron to be an agent of change. Help make new art happen.
